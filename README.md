## üîç Technical Skills Demonstrated

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction
- **Software Design Patterns**: Implementation of common design patterns in C#
- **Database Integration**: Entity Framework for database operations and data modeling
- **Web Development**: ASP.NET MVC for creating responsive and scalable web applications
- **Clean Code Practices**: SOLID principles, code organization, and documentation

## üöÄ Getting Started

Each project in this portfolio is designed to be easily run and explored:

```bash
# Clone any repository of interest
git clone https://github.com/mehmetgogusss/[repository-name]

# Open the solution file in Visual Studio
# Build and run the application
```

## üìà Learning Journey

This portfolio represents my progression as a C# developer:

1. **Fundamentals**: Starting with core C# syntax and basic OOP concepts
2. **Advanced OOP**: Moving to more complex implementations like interfaces and polymorphism
3. **Applied Development**: Translating theoretical knowledge into practical applications
4. **Full-Stack Development**: Building complete web applications with database integration
